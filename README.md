Building Candy Crush using Python (only logic of the game not UI)
In order to build a candy crush game using python, we need to find a library of english words. We can then select one random word from the dictionary and remove certain characters from the word. This will leave us with a hint of the meaning of the word. If we are able to complete the game without making any mistakes, then we can add points to our score. However, if we make three mistakes, then the game is over and our final score is displayed.
